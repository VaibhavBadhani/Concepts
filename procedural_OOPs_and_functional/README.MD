Procedural Programming
Uses a set of instructions in a clear logical sequence. Uses functions, loops, local and global variables. Its's normally
very simple and easy to see control flow.

Object Oriented Programming
Seprates code into separate objects, all with their own variables and methods.Promotes modularity, code reuse and abstraction.

Functional Programming
Tries to program similar to mathematical equations. All variables are immutable and every function will always give the same 
outcome. Uses recursion and can be easier to fing bugs.
